Map viewer/editor. Initial idea was to make an alternative for OCAD (Comercial cartography software).
As now good alternative already exists (https://openorienteering.github.io/) - this project became abandoned.

It still could be useful for someone who would like to work with OCAD files from Python. 
Not all OCAD file format features were implemented. 

I still like the idea of open text file format for map data (example:. dump.fcad) and separate style format (example:. dump.css).
